# Open-Source Low-Cost Rover Platform

🚧 **Status: Active Development** 🚧

An accessible, modular rover platform for robotics education and research.

## Project Goals

- [ ] Mechanical platform design (In Progress)
- [ ] ROS2 navigation stack integration
- [ ] Sensor fusion (RGB + depth cameras)
- [ ] Autonomous waypoint navigation
- [ ] Obstacle avoidance
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for community contribution

## Planned Architecture

The rover will feature:
- **Mobile base:** Custom chassis with differential drive
- **Compute:** Jetson Nano or equivalent (ROS2 Humble)
- **Sensors:** Intel RealSense D435, IMU, wheel encoders
- **Navigation:** Nav2 stack with SLAM
- **Control:** Low-level motor control with Arduino/Teensy
